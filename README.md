# TempleOfBoom-py
A Python script that reads a Spotify playlist, 'Temple Of Boom', and dumps it to a Google sheet for archiving each week. Managed by a cron job on my personal Linux server to run every Thursday at noon, EST.

# Dependencies
[Spotipy](https://github.com/plamere/spotipy)
[Google Spreadsheets Python API v4](https://github.com/nithinmurali/pygsheets)

Just pip install spotipy and pygsheets.
